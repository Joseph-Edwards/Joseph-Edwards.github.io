My name is Joe, and I'm a PhD student studying mathematics at the [University of
St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/). I'm a member of both the [Algebra and Combinatorics group](https://algebra-combinatorics.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/), and the
[Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Computational Algebra (CIRCA)](https://circa.st-andrews.ac.uk/).

My main area of research is in computational semigroup theory, specifically
focusing on efficient implementations of the Knuth Bendix string rewriting
procedure for semigroups and monoids.

I began my studies in September 2023, and work under the supervision of
[Professor James Mitchell](https://jdbm.me/).

On top of my maths research, I also enjoy contributing to open-source software projects. To see a selection of the projects I have contributed to, see my [software page](/software). Alternatively, for a deeper dive, see my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Joseph-Edwards).
